# Heartbleed ([CVE-2014-0160](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=cve-2014-0160))

**CVE-2014-0160 (Heartbleed)** is a critical vulnerability in the OpenSSL library discovered in April 2014, allowing attackers to access sensitive information (e.g., usernames, passwords) protected by SSL/TLS encryption.

It affected numerous websites and services, including Yahoo, Google, and PayPal, raising significant concerns about online security. The bug stems from a flaw in the OpenSSL code related to the heartbeat extension of the TLS/DTLS protocol, enabling attackers to send a crafted heartbeat request that discloses portions of a server's memory, potentially revealing private keys and session cookies.

A patch for the vulnerability was quickly released, and affected organizations were advised to update their OpenSSL software and revoke and reissue their SSL/TLS certificates. It's essential to keep software and systems up to date to mitigate the risk of vulnerabilities like Heartbleed.

## Exploit it using Nmap
``` bash
nmap -p 443 --script ssl-heartbleed <target>
#Detects whether a server is vulnerable to the OpenSSL Heartbleed bug (CVE-2014-0160). The code is based on the Python script ssltest.py authored by Katie Stafford (katie@ktpanda.org)

nmap -sV --script ssl-enum-ciphers -p 443 <host>
#This script repeatedly initiates SSLv3/TLS connections, each time trying a new cipher or compressor while recording whether a host accepts or rejects it. The end result is a list of all the ciphersuites and compressors that a server accepts.
```


# EternalBlue - MS17-010 (CVE-2017-0143)

**CVE-2017-0143 (EternalBlue)** is a security vulnerability in the Microsoft Windows SMB protocol that allows remote attackers to execute [arbitrary code](https://nordvpn.com/cybersecurity/glossary/arbitrary-code-execution/)on vulnerable systems. It was exploited by the WannaCry ransomware attack in 27 May 2017, causing widespread disruption.

Microsoft released a patch on Marc h, 2017, but many organizations failed to apply it, leaving systems vulnerable. While WannaCry is the most notable exploit, the vulnerability can be used for various malicious purposes, highlighting the importance of keeping systems updated.

## Exploit it using Nmap

``` bash

nmap -p445 --script smb-vuln-ms17-010 <target>
  
nmap -p445 --script vuln <target>

#Attempts to detect if a Microsoft SMBv1 server is vulnerable to a remote code execution vulnerability (ms17-010, a.k.a. EternalBlue). The vulnerability is actively exploited by WannaCry and Petya ransomware and other malware.
```

# Log4J ([CVE-2021-44228](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-44228))

CVE-2021-44228, known as Log4Shell, is a critical vulnerability in Apache Log4j that allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable servers via specially crafted requests. With a CVSS score of 10.0, it represents the highest severity level.

Disclosed in December 2021, Log4Shell has been actively exploited, prompting urgent remediation efforts across the tech industry. Organizations are strongly advised to upgrade to Log4j version 2.17.1 or later to mitigate risks.

**Key Actions:**

- **Immediate Updates**: Upgrade to the latest version of Log4j.
- **Monitoring**: Implement continuous monitoring for exploitation attempts.
- **Audits**: Review applications using Log4j to identify vulnerabilities.

By taking these steps, organizations can significantly reduce their risk and enhance their security posture against this critical vulnerability.

## Pass-The-Hash 
- Tool/metasploit module  uses: 
	- **PsExec** is a command-line tool from Microsoft's Sysinternals suite that allows users to execute processes on remote systems. It enables administrators to run commands and applications on remote computers without needing to log into them directly. Key features include:

- **Remote Execution**: Run processes on remote systems as if they were local.
- **Interactive Sessions**: Option to run commands interactively or in the background.
- **Credential Support**: Allows the use of different user credentials for executing commands.
- **File Transfer**: Can copy files to and from remote systems during execution.

PsExec is commonly used for system administration, troubleshooting, and automation tasks in Windows environments.
