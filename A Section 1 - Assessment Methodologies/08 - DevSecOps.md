**DevSecOps** integrates security practices into the DevOps process, fostering collaboration among development, security, and operations teams to enhance security throughout the software development lifecycle.

#### Key Principles:

- **Security as Code**: Embed security controls in code, similar to infrastructure as code.
- **Automation**: Automate security scanning, testing, and monitoring (e.g., dependency and vulnerability scanning).
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Monitor for vulnerabilities and compliance issues in real-time.
- **Collaboration**: Foster teamwork among Dev, Sec, and Ops for shared goals and transparency.
- **Shift Left**: Implement security testing early in the development lifecycle.
- **Continuous Integration and Delivery**: Integrate security checks in the CI/CD pipeline.
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Use code to define and provision infrastructure for consistent security.
- **Risk Management**: Prioritize vulnerabilities based on business impact and continuously assess cyber risk.
- **Security Automation**: Automate security tasks to enhance efficiency and consistency.
